ShortDescription: Developer toolkit — built by developers, for developers
Description: |-
  Toorker is a Swiss-design, utility-first desktop application that consolidates essential developer tools into a single, fast, and beautiful interface. Built with Tauri, React 19, and TypeScript, it offers native performance with a modern web-based UI.
  
  Features include system monitoring (ports, processes), API testing, converters (number base, date, color, cron), formatters (JSON, Markdown, Base64, URL, HTML, JWT), generators (UUID, hash, password, Lorem Ipsum, gradients), text tools (regex tester, text diff), and a smart command palette with natural language parsing.
